I still can’t give this paper a recommendation to publish. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology, and this method is not developed adequately in section 3.3.2. I cannot know whether or not to believe that it works without either a more detailed derivation or at the very least a simulation study. Equations 9-10 are not a proof, and the notation in them is not consistent with the text. In referencing prior art, the authors do not even attempt to explain the relationship of the current approach to regime-switching (Hamilton, 1990), which seems like the obvious ancestor, or why they would call something a two-layer HMM when that term is already used to mean something else (Zhang, 2004). The technical limitations section 5.1 is not adequate either in my opinion. The smallness of observation probabilities is not the issue, the issue appears to be that an exponentially large number of probabilities are being estimated. Maybe I’m wrong about this, but, given the absence of a derivation, it’s impossible to know.

There are many other points I would take issue with (education arguments; the statistics of table 2, which I already called foul; etc.), but they are all moot if I don’t know whether or not the model itself can be trusted. The inadequate derivation and absence of a simulation study are a deal-breaker for me.
