% The parameter given to the `\documentclass' command can be one of:
%   `preprint', `submission', or `final'.
% These control the presence of certain features for each stage of the authoring
% process. For example, `submission' does not output the author block, and
% `final' disables page numbers.
%
% The \preprintonly{}, \submissiononly{}, and \finalonly{} commands allow you
% to wrap text that will only be output under the corresponding option.

\begin{abstract}
  Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide educators with an abundance
  of data describing how students interact with the platform, but this data
  is highly underutilized today. This is in part due to the lack of
  sophisticated tools to provide interpretable and actionable summaries of
  huge amounts of MOOC activity present in log data. To address this problem, we
  propose a student behavior representation method alongside a method for
  automatically discovering those student behavior patterns by leveraging
  the click log data that can be obtained from the MOOC platform itself.
  Specifically, we propose the use of a two-layer hidden Markov model
  (2L-HMM) to extract our desired behavior representation, and show that
  patterns extracted by such a 2L-HMM are interpretable and meaningful. We
  demonstrate that the proposed 2L-HMM can also be used to extract latent
  features from student behavioral data that correlate with educational
  outcomes.
