%% SIGCHI Proceedings Format (modern) Sample Document
%% This sample file demonstrates the use of the `sigchi-modern' class file.
%%
%% The content of this document draws heavily on the `HCI Archive Format'
%% template supplied by SIGCHI, but has been modified to demonstrate and
%% document the LaTeX class.

% The parameter given to the `\documentclass' command can be one of:
%   `preprint', `submission', or `final'.
% These control the presence of certain features for each stage of the authoring
% process. For example, `submission' does not output the author block, and
% `final' disables page numbers.
%
% The \preprintonly{}, \submissiononly{}, and \finalonly{} commands allow you
% to wrap text that will only be output under the corresponding option.
\documentclass[preprint]{sigchi-modern}

% These packages aren't required, but do provide some helpful features that are
% used in this sample.
\usepackage{graphicx}  % Graphics for figures
\usepackage{booktabs}  % Nice formatting for tables
\usepackage{balance}   % Attempts to balance the columns on the last page

% A nice way to help avoid overful lines handing out into the margins is the
% `microtype' package, which lets certain characters extrude a *little* bit.
\usepackage{microtype}
% If the situation becomes dire, use:
%\sloppy

% You may use any bibliography package as long as the output matches that of
% the prescribed format. `natbib' is a fairly nice default, and the provided
% BibTeX style file has been tested with it.
\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{acm-sigchi-modern}

% Define these tokens as appropriate for the conference to generate the

\begin{abstract}
  Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide educators with an abundance
  of data describing how students interact with the platform, but this data
  is highly underutilized today. This is in part due to the lack of
  sophisticated tools to provide interpretable and actionable summaries of
  huge amounts of MOOC activity present in log data. In this paper, we
  propose a method for automatically discovering student behavior patterns
  by leveraging the click log data that can be obtained from the MOOC
  platform itself in a completely unsupervised manner.
