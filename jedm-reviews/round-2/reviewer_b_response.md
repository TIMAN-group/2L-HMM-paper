We again thank you for your help in improving the quality of our abstract.

We agree that this added section brings much more clarity to the technical
challenges and potential limitations of our approach, and thank you for the
feedback leading to this improvement to the paper.

Thank you for the detailed list of suggestions. In the revision, we have
incorporated these suggested changes to the wording and have also done
another editing pass to attempt to correct additional errors of similar
form. We hope that the readability and clarity of the work has improved as
a direct result.
